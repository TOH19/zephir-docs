Почему Zephir?
==============
Today’s PHP applications must balance a number of concerns including stability, performance and functionality.
Every PHP application is based on a set of common components that are also base for most of the application.

These common components are libraries/frameworks or a combination of them. Once installed, frameworks rarely
change, being the foundation of the application they must be highly functional and also very fast.

Getting fast and robust libraries can be complicated due to high levels of abstraction that are
typically implemented on them. Given the condition that base libraries or frameworks rarely change,
there is an opportunity to build extensions that provide this functionality taking advantage of the
compilation improving performance and resource consumption.

With Zephir, you can implement object-oriented libraries/frameworks/applications that can be used from
PHP gaining important seconds that can make your application faster while improving the user experience.

Если ты PHP программист...
--------------------------
PHP is one of the most popular languages in use for the development of web applications.
Dynamically typed and interpreted languages like PHP offer very high productivity due to their flexibility.

Since version 4 and then 5, PHP is based on the Zend Engine implementation. This is a virtual machine
that executes the PHP code from its bytecode representation. Zend Engine is almost present in every
PHP installation in the world, with Zephir, you can create extensions for PHP running under the
Zend Engine.

PHP is hosting Zephir, so they obviously have a lot of similarities, however; they have
important differences that give Zephir its own personality. For example, Zephir is more strict,
and it could be make you less productive compared to PHP due to the compilation step.

Если ты C программист...
------------------------
C is one of the most powerful and popular languages ever created. In fact, PHP is written in C,
which is one of the reasons why PHP extensions are available for it. C gives you the freedom to
manage memory, use low level types and even inline assembly routines.

However, developing big applications in C can take much longer than expected compared to PHP or Zephir
and some errors can be tricky to find if you aren't an experienced developer.

Zephir was designed to be safe, so it doesn't implement pointers or manual memory management, so
if you're a C programmer, you will feel Zephir less powerful but more friendly than C.

Компиляция против интерпретации
-------------------------------
Compilation usually slows the development down; you will need a bit more of patience to make your code
compiled before running it. Moreover, the interpretation tends to reduce the performance in favor of
productivity. In some cases, there is no any noticeable difference between the speed of the
interpreted and compiled code.

Zephir requires compilation of your code, however, the functionality is used from PHP that is interpreted.

Once the code is compiled is not necessary to do so, however, interpreted code is interpreted each time
it is run. A developer can decide which parts of your application should be in Zephir and which not.

Статическая типизация против динамической типизации
---------------------------------------------------
In general speaking, in a static typed language, a variable is bound to a particular type for its lifetime.
Its type can’t be changed and it can only reference type-compatible instances and operations.
Languages like C/C++ were implemented with the scheme:

.. code-block:: c

	int a = 0;
	a = "hello"; // не позволяется

In dynamic typing, the type is bound to the value, not the variable. So, a variable might refer
to a value of a type, then be reassigned later to a value of an unrelated type. Javascript/PHP are examples of
a dynamic typed language:

.. code-block:: zephir

	var a = 0;
	a = "hello"; // позволяется

Despite their productivity advantages, dynamic languages may not be the best choices for all applications,
particularly for very large code bases and high-performance applications.

Optimizing the performance of a dynamic language like PHP is more challenging than for a static language like C.
In a static language, optimizers can exploit the type information to make decisions. In a dynamic language,
fewer such clues are available for the optimizer, making optimization choices harder.

While recent advancements in optimizations for dynamic languages are promising (like JIT compilation),
they lag behind the state of the art for static languages. So, if you require very high performance,
static languages are probably a safer choice.

Another small benefit of static languages is the extra checking the compiler performs.
A compiler can’t find logic errors, which are far more significant,
but a compiler can find errors in advance that in a dynamic language only can be
found in runtime.

Zephir is both statically and dynamically typed allowing you to take advantage from both sides where
possible.

Схема компиляции
----------------
Zephir offers native code generation (currently via compilation to C), a compiler like gcc/clang/vc++
optimizes and compiles the code down to machine code. The following graph shows how the process works:

.. figure:: ../_static/img/scheme.png
    :align: center

In addition to the ones provided by Zephir, Over time, compilers have been implemented
and matured a number of optimizations that improve the performance of compiled applications:

* `GCC optimizations <http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.1.0/gcc/Optimize-Options.html>`_
* `LLVM passes <http://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html>`_
* `Visual C/C++ optimizations <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k1ack8f1.aspx>`_

Защита кода
-----------
In some circumstances, the compilation does not significantly improve performance, this may be because the bottleneck is located
in the I/O bound of the application (quite likely) rather than compute/memory bound.
However, compiling code could also bring some level of intelectual protection to your application.
With Zephir, producing native binaries, you also get the ability to hide the code to users or customers.

Заключение
----------
Zephir was not created to replace PHP or C, instead of this, we think it is a complement to them,
allowing developers to venture into code compilation and static typing.
Zephir is precisely an attempt to join good things from the C and PHP worlds,
looking for opportunities to make their applications faster.
